### **Understanding `float e20, e01, e12` in 2D Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)**

In **2D Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)**, `{ float e20, e01, e12; }` represents a **bivector**, which in this case corresponds to a **line** in 2D space.

#### **1. What Does a Bivector Represent in 2D PGA?**
- In **2D PGA**, a bivector represents an **oriented line**.
- Lines in homogeneous coordinates are typically written as:

  $$
  L = e_{12} a + e_{20} b + e_{01} c
  $$

  where:
  - \( e_{12} \) represents the **x-coefficient** of the line.
  - \( e_{20} \) represents the **y-coefficient** of the line.
  - \( e_{01} \) represents the **constant term** (the offset from the origin).

- The equation of a line in standard **homogeneous coordinates** is:

  $$
  ax + by + c = 0
  $$

  which corresponds to:
  - \( e_{12} = a \)
  - \( e_{20} = b \)
  - \( e_{01} = c \)

Thus, the structure:
```cpp
struct {
    float e20, e01, e12;
};
```
is simply a **storage format for a line** in 2D **Projective Geometric Algebra**.

#### **2. Why These Names?**
The notation \( e_{12}, e_{20}, e_{01} \) comes from **Geometric Algebra basis blades**, where:
- \( e_1 \) and \( e_2 \) are the two **basis vectors**.
- \( e_{12} \) is the **bivector** formed by \( e_1 \wedge e_2 \) (which represents an area in 2D).
- \( e_{20} \) and \( e_{01} \) are **cyclic permutations** involving the projective basis \( e_0 \), which represents the **homogeneous coordinate**.

#### **3. Interpreting `e20, e01, e12` in Geometric Algebra**
- `e20` â†’ corresponds to the **y-coefficient** of the line.
- `e01` â†’ corresponds to the **constant term** of the line.
- `e12` â†’ corresponds to the **x-coefficient** of the line.

Thus, in terms of the familiar line equation \( ax + by + c = 0 \):

  $$
  L = e_{12} x + e_{20} y + e_{01} = 0
  $$

---

#### **4. Example: Using Bivectors for Lines**
Suppose you have the line equation:

  $$
  3x - 4y + 5 = 0
  $$

The **PGA representation** would be:

  $$
  e_{12} = 3, \quad e_{20} = -4, \quad e_{01} = 5
  $$

And in C++:
```cpp
struct Line {
    float e20, e01, e12; // Representation of a 2D PGA line
};

Line L = {-4, 5, 3}; // Represents 3x - 4y + 5 = 0
```

---

### **Summary**
| **Component** | **Meaning** |
|-------------|-----------|
| `e20` | y-coefficient of the line (related to \( b \) in \( ax + by + c = 0 \)) |
| `e01` | Constant term (offset, related to \( c \)) |
| `e12` | x-coefficient of the line (related to \( a \)) |

In **2D PGA**, a **bivector (e20, e01, e12)** represents a **line** in projective space.
