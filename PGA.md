### **Understanding `float e20, e01, e12` in 2D Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)**

In **2D Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)**, `{ float e20, e01, e12; }` represents a **bivector**, which in this case corresponds to a **line** in 2D space.

#### **1. What Does a Bivector Represent in 2D PGA?**
- In **2D PGA**, a bivector represents an **oriented line**.
- Lines in homogeneous coordinates are typically written as:

  $$
  L = e_{12} a + e_{20} b + e_{01} c
  $$

  where:
  - \( e_{12} \) represents the **x-coefficient** of the line.
  - \( e_{20} \) represents the **y-coefficient** of the line.
  - \( e_{01} \) represents the **constant term** (the offset from the origin).

- The equation of a line in standard **homogeneous coordinates** is:

  $$
  ax + by + c = 0
  $$

  which corresponds to:
  - \( e_{12} = a \)
  - \( e_{20} = b \)
  - \( e_{01} = c \)

Thus, the structure:
```cpp
struct {
    float e20, e01, e12;
};
```
is simply a **storage format for a line** in 2D **Projective Geometric Algebra**.

---

#### **2. Why These Names?**
The notation \( e_{12}, e_{20}, e_{01} \) comes from **Geometric Algebra basis blades**, where:
- \( e_1 \) and \( e_2 \) are the two **basis vectors**.
- \( e_{12} \) is the **bivector** formed by \( e_1 \wedge e_2 \) (which represents an area in 2D).
- \( e_{20} \) and \( e_{01} \) are **cyclic permutations** involving the projective basis \( e_0 \), which represents the **homogeneous coordinate**.

#### **3. Interpreting `e20, e01, e12` in Geometric Algebra**
- `e20` â†’ corresponds to the **y-coefficient** of the line.
- `e01` â†’ corresponds to the **constant term** of the line.
- `e12` â†’ corresponds to the **x-coefficient** of the line.

Thus, in terms of the familiar line equation \( ax + by + c = 0 \):

  $$
  L = e_{12} x + e_{20} y + e_{01} = 0
  $$

---

#### **4. Example: Using Bivectors for Lines**
Suppose you have the line equation:

  $$
  3x - 4y + 5 = 0
  $$

The **PGA representation** would be:

  $$
  e_{12} = 3, \quad e_{20} = -4, \quad e_{01} = 5
  $$

And in C++:
```cpp
struct Line {
    float e20, e01, e12; // Representation of a 2D PGA line
};

Line L = {-4, 5, 3}; // Represents 3x - 4y + 5 = 0
```

### **Summary**
| **Component** | **Meaning** |
|-------------|-----------|
| `e20` | y-coefficient of the line (related to \( b \) in \( ax + by + c = 0 \)) |
| `e01` | Constant term (offset, related to \( c \)) |
| `e12` | x-coefficient of the line (related to \( a \)) |

In **2D PGA**, a **bivector (e20, e01, e12)** represents a **line** in projective space.

### **Primal vs. Dual Approach in 2D Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)**

In **Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA)**, the **primal approach** and the **dual approach** refer to two different ways of representing geometric objects and computing operations like intersections.

---

## **1. Primal Approach**
ðŸ‘‰ **In the primal approach, we work with objects directly in their natural representation.**
- **Points** are represented as **vectors**.
- **Lines** are represented as **bivectors**.
- **The intersection (meet) of two lines is computed using the **wedge product (\(\wedge\))**.

### **Example in 2D PGA (Primal Approach)**
- A **point** \( P \) is represented as:
  \[
  P = x e_1 + y e_2 + w e_0
  \]
- A **line** \( L \) is represented as a **bivector**:
  \[
  L = a e_{12} + b e_{20} + c e_{01}
  \]
  This corresponds to the standard line equation:  
  \[
  ax + by + c = 0
  \]
- The **intersection (meet) of two lines** \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) is:
  \[
  P = L_1 \wedge L_2
  \]
  This directly gives a **point in homogeneous coordinates**.

### **Why Use the Primal Approach?**
âœ… It is **intuitive**â€”we use the wedge product (\(\wedge\)) to compute intersections.  
âœ… It follows **exterior algebra principles** naturally.  
âœ… It is widely used in **computer vision** and **geometric computing**.

---

## **2. Dual Approach**
ðŸ‘‰ **In the dual approach, we think of geometric objects as their dual representations.**
- **Lines** are represented as **vectors**.
- **Points** are represented as **bivectors**.
- **The intersection (meet) of two lines is computed using the **dot product (\(\cdot\))**.

### **Example in 2D PGA (Dual Approach)**
- A **line** \( L \) is represented as a **vector**:
  \[
  L = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_0
  \]
- A **point** \( P \) is represented as a **bivector**:
  \[
  P = p_{12} e_{12} + p_{20} e_{20} + p_{01} e_{01}
  \]
- The **intersection (meet) of two lines** \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) is computed using:
  \[
  P = L_1 \cdot L_2
  \]
  This **dualizes the wedge product** and produces the same result but from a different perspective.

### **Why Use the Dual Approach?**
âœ… It is sometimes easier to **implement in algebraic systems**.  
âœ… It avoids the need for explicit **exterior algebra operations** in some frameworks.  
âœ… It is used in **your slides** (probably because it's more aligned with matrix-based projective geometry).

## **3. Comparison: Primal vs. Dual Approach**
| **Concept** | **Primal Approach (Wedge Product \(\wedge\))** | **Dual Approach (Dot Product \(\cdot\))** |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Lines are** | Bivectors \( L = e_{12}, e_{20}, e_{01} \) | Vectors \( L = e_1, e_2, e_0 \) |
| **Points are** | Vectors \( P = e_1, e_2, e_0 \) | Bivectors \( P = e_{12}, e_{20}, e_{01} \) |
| **Meet (Intersection of Two Lines)** | \( P = L_1 \wedge L_2 \) | \( P = L_1 \cdot L_2 \) |
| **Join (Line from Two Points)** | \( L = P_1 \wedge P_2 \) | \( L = P_1 \cdot P_2 \) |
| **Used in** | Scott McLean's notation, Exterior Algebra | Your slides, Projective Geometry |

---

## **4. Example: Computing Intersection in C++**
Hereâ€™s how you can compute the **intersection (meet) of two lines** using both approaches.

### **Primal Approach (Wedge Product)**
```cpp
struct Line {
    float e12, e20, e01;  // Bivector representation of a line
};

struct Point {
    float x, y, w;  // Homogeneous coordinates
};

// Meet of two lines (Primal approach using Wedge product)
Point meet(const Line& L1, const Line& L2) {
    Point P;
    P.x = L1.e01 * L2.e20 - L2.e01 * L1.e20;
    P.y = L1.e12 * L2.e01 - L2.e12 * L1.e01;
    P.w = L1.e20 * L2.e12 - L2.e20 * L1.e12;
    return P;
}
```

### **Dual Approach (Dot Product)**
```cpp
struct Line {
    float a, b, c;  // Vector representation of a line
};

struct Point {
    float e12, e20, e01;  // Bivector representation of a point
};

// Meet of two lines (Dual approach using Dot product)
Point meet(const Line& L1, const Line& L2) {
    Point P;
    P.e12 = L1.b * L2.c - L2.b * L1.c;
    P.e20 = L1.c * L2.a - L2.c * L1.a;
    P.e01 = L1.a * L2.b - L2.a * L1.b;
    return P;
}
```

---

## **5. Which Should You Use?**
### **Use the Primal Approach if:**
âœ… You are following **Scott McLean's notation**.  
âœ… You want a **direct geometric interpretation** of objects.  
âœ… You prefer working with **exterior algebra operations**.  

### **Use the Dual Approach if:**
âœ… You are following **your slides**.  
âœ… You are using **matrix-based projective geometry methods**.  
âœ… You prefer working with **dot products instead of wedge products**.

---

### **Final Answer**
Both methods **compute the same intersection point** but through different representations. If your slides define **meet as \( L_1 \cdot L_2 \)**, you are using the **dual approach**. If Scott McLean uses **\( L_1 \wedge L_2 \)**, he is using the **primal approach**.
